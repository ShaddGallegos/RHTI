# Ansible Workshop - Ansible for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (90 mins)

Ansible is a simple yet powerful IT automation engine for application deployment, configuration management, and orchestration that you can learn quickly.

## Presentations

The exercises are self explanatory and guide the participants through the entire lab. All concepts are explained when they are introduced.

There is an optional presentation available to support the workshops and explain Automation, the basics of Ansible and the topics of the exercises in more detail:
