# this is a demo of how the user commands work and how to reference salted passwords
# in vars sections.  You could also use vars_files if you like (see other examples)

- hosts: all
  remote_user: root
  vars:
    # created with:
    # python -c 'import crypt; print crypt.crypt("This is my Password", "$1$SomeSalt$")'
    password: $1$SomeSalt$UqddPX3r4kH3UL5jq5/ZI.

  tasks:

    # Walk through account creation, modification, and deletion
    - name: test basic user account creation
      user: name=tset comment=TsetUser group=users shell=/sbin/nologin createhome=no

    # the following is just a simple example of how you don't have to include
    # the 'name' element for each task

    - user: name=tset comment=NyetUser
    - user: name=tset password={{password}}

    # The following will add the user to supplementary groups.

    # Add the user to the groups dialout and uucp.
    - user: name=tset groups=dialout,uucp

    # Add the user to the groups dialout and wheel,
    # This will remove tset from the group uucp.
    - user: name=tset groups=dialout,wheel

    # Add the user to the group uucp.  Because append=yes, the user
    # will not be removed from the groups dialout and wheel.
    - user: name=tset groups=uucp append=yes

    # Finally, remove the user.
    - user: name=tset state=absent
