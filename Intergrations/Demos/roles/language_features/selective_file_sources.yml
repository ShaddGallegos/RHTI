# this is an example of how to template a file over using some variables derived
# from the system.  For instance, if you wanted to have different configuration
# templates by OS version, this is a neat way to do it.  Any Ansible facts, facter facts,
# or ohai facts could be used to do this.

- hosts: all

  tasks:

  - name: template a config file
    template: dest=/etc/imaginary_file.conf
    first_available_file:

       # first see if we have a file for this specific host
       - /srv/whatever/{{ansible_hostname}}.conf

       # next try to load something like CentOS6.2.conf
       - /srv/whatever/{{ansible_distribution}}{{ansible_distribution_version}}.conf

       # next see if there's a CentOS.conf
       - /srv/whatever/{{ansible_distribution}}.conf

       # finally give up and just use something generic
       - /srv/whatever/default
