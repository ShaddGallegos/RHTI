This Ansible collection allows for easy interaction with an AWX or Ansible Tower server via Ansible roles using the AWX/Tower collection modules.

## Included content

Click the `Content` button to see the list of content included in this collection.

## Installing this collection

You can install the redhat_cop tower_configuration collection with the Ansible Galaxy CLI:

    ansible-galaxy collection install redhat_cop.tower_configuration

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it with `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml`, using the format:

```yaml
---
collections:
  - name: redhat_cop.tower_configuration
    # If you need a specific version of the collection, you can specify like this:
    # version: ...
```

## Using this collection
The awx.awx or ansible.tower collection must be invoked in the playbook in order for ansible to pick up the correct modules to use.

Otherwise it will look for the modules only in your base installation. If there are errors complaining about "couldn't resolve module/action" this is the most likely cause.

```yaml
- name: Playbook to configure ansible tower post installation
  hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  vars:
    tower_validate_certs: false
  collections:
    - awx.awx
```

Define following vars here, or in `tower_configs/tower_auth.yml`
`tower_hostname: ansible-tower-web-svc-test-project.example.com`

You can also specify authentication by a combination of either:

 - `tower_hostname`, `tower_username`, `tower_password`
 - `tower_hostname`, `tower_oauthtoken`

The OAuth2 token is the preferred method. You can obtain the token through the prefered `tower_token` module, or through the
AWX CLI [login](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/towercli/reference.html#awx-login)
command.

These can be specified via (from highest to lowest precedence):

 - direct role variables as mentioned above
 - environment variables (most useful when running against localhost)
 - a config file path specified by the `tower_config_file` parameter
 - a config file at `~/.tower_cli.cfg`
 - a config file at `/etc/tower/tower_cli.cfg`

Config file syntax looks like this:

```
[general]
host = https://localhost:8043
verify_ssl = true
oauth_token = LEdCpKVKc4znzffcpQL5vLG8oyeku6
```

Tower token module would be invoked with this code:
```yaml
    - name: Create a new token using tower username/password
      awx.awx.tower_token:
        description: 'Creating token to test tower jobs'
        scope: "write"
        state: present
        tower_host: "{{ tower_hostname }}"
        tower_username: "{{ tower_username }}"
        tower_password: "{{ tower_password }}"

```

### Tower Export
