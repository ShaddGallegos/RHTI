# These packages must be explicitly installed during the pulp role, after the
# venv is created. Otherwise, older versions of pip that lack PEP517/PEP518
# support cannot use them to build createrepo_c or libcomps.
#
# Also note that the following replacement values do not work:
# - pip>=19<20
# - setuptools>=40.8<41
# Due to this issue:
